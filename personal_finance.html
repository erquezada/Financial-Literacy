        <h2>Investing</h2> <!-- Subheading for the investing section -->
        <p>Investing is a crucial aspect of personal finance that involves putting your money to work to generate returns over time. It offers the potential to grow your wealth significantly through various investment vehicles such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and real estate. By investing, you can harness the power of compounding and build a diversified portfolio to mitigate risks and achieve your financial goals.</p>

        <h3>Fixed Expenses</h3> <!-- Sub-subheading for fixed expenses -->
        <p>Fixed expenses are essential costs that remain constant from month to month. These expenses typically include housing payments (rent or mortgage), insurance premiums, loan repayments, and subscription services. Since fixed expenses are predictable, they allow for easier budgeting and planning of your finances.</p>
        <h3>Flexible Expenses</h3> <!-- Sub-subheading for flexible expenses -->
        <p>Flexible expenses are discretionary costs that can vary from month to month based on your lifestyle and choices. These expenses may include groceries, dining out, entertainment, travel, and miscellaneous purchases. While flexible expenses offer more freedom and spontaneity in spending, they require careful monitoring to avoid overspending and maintain financial stability.</p>
        <h3>Total Expenses</h3> <!-- Sub-subheading for total expenses -->
        <p>Total expenses represent the sum of both fixed and flexible expenses. Calculating your total expenses provides a comprehensive overview of your monthly financial obligations and helps you assess whether your spending aligns with your income. By understanding your total expenses, you can identify areas where you may need to adjust your budget and prioritize your spending accordingly.</p>
        <h3>Total Monthly Income</h3> <!-- Sub-subheading for total monthly income -->
        <p>Total monthly income encompasses all sources of revenue you receive within a month, including salaries, wages, bonuses, commissions, rental income, and any other forms of income. It serves as the foundation for your budgeting process, providing the financial resources necessary to cover your expenses, save for the future, and pursue your financial goals.</p>
        <h3>Disposable Income</h3> <!-- Sub-subheading for disposable income -->
        <p>Disposable income is the amount of money you have available for spending or saving after deducting taxes from your total income. It represents the portion of your earnings that is not allocated to essential expenses or mandatory savings. Disposable income gives you the freedom to make discretionary purchases, invest in additional savings or retirement accounts, or indulge in leisure activities, thereby enhancing your overall quality of life.</p>
