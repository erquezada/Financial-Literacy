            <p><strong>Credit Cards & Credit Scores:</strong></p>
            <p>
                <strong>What is credit?:</strong> Credit refers to a financial
                arrangement, such as a credit card, loan, or mortgage, which
                allows you to borrow money from a bank and pay it back later.
                Owning a credit card contributes to your credit score, a
                three-digit number ranging from 300 to 850 that represents your
                creditworthiness. This score is calculated based on your credit
                history, including payment history, amounts owed, and the length
                of your credit history. A good credit score can lead to loan
                approvals with more favorable terms.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Ranges:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Excellent - 800 to 850</li>
                <li>Very good - 740 to 799</li>
                <li>Good - 670 to 739</li>
                <li>Fair - 580 to 669</li>
                <li>Poor - 300 to 579</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Importance of credit:</strong></p>
            <p>
                Having credit is important for several reasons. It can provide
                financial flexibility, allowing you to make big purchases, such
                as a car or a house, something that you may not be able to
                afford upfront. Additionally, having a good credit score can
                lead to lower interest rates on loans and credit cards, which
                can save you money over time. For example, landlords may check
                your credit history to determine reliability, making good credit
                crucial for rental applications.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Proper usage:</strong></p>
            <p>
                To use credit cards properly, it involves a responsibility of
                financial management. This includes paying off your balance in
                full each month to avoid interest, not maxing out your credit
                limit, and making payments on time to avoid late fees and
                negative impacts on your credit score. More importantly, only
                use credit for planned purchases or emergencies, not for impulse
                buying. By doing so, you can build a strong credit history,
                increase your credit score, and benefit from the financial
                opportunities that good credit provides.

            <p><strong>Credit card types:</strong></p>
            <p>There are different types of credit cards:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Airline Credit Cards:</strong> Airline credit cards
                    are tailored for frequent travelers. These cards typically
                    offer rewards in the form of airline miles or points for
                    every dollar spent on purchases, which can then be redeemed
                    for flights, upgrades, and other travel-related perks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Cashback Credit Cards:</strong> Cashback credit
                    cards offer a percentage of the purchase amount back to the
                    cardholder as a rebate or statement credit. This type of
                    credit card is popular because it provides tangible benefits
                    in the form of cash rewards for everyday spending.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Store Credit Cards:</strong> Store credit cards are
                    issued by retailers and can only be used for purchases at
                    specific stores or within a particular retail network. These
                    cards often come with incentives such as discounts on
                    purchases, special financing offers, or loyalty rewards for
                    frequent shoppers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Student Credit Cards:</strong> Student credit cards
                    are designed for college students who are new to credit or
                    have limited credit history. These cards often have lower
                    credit limits and more relaxed approval criteria compared to
                    traditional credit cards, making them accessible to students
                    with little or no credit history.
