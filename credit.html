    <p><strong>Credit Cards & Credit Scores:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>What is credit?:</strong> Credit refers to a financial arrangement, such as a credit card, loan, or mortgage, which allows you to borrow money from a bank and pay it back later. Owning a credit card contributes to your credit score, a three-digit number ranging from 300 to 850 that represents your creditworthiness. This score is calculated based on your credit history, including payment history, amounts owed, and the length of your credit history. A good credit score can lead to loan approvals with more favorable terms.</p>
    <p><strong>Ranges:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Excellent - 800 to 850</li>
        <li>Very good - 740 to 799</li>
        <li>Good - 670 to 739</li>
        <li>Fair - 580 to 669</li>
        <li>Poor - 300 to 579</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Importance of credit:</strong></p>
    <p>Having credit is important for several reasons. It can provide financial flexibility, allowing you to make big purchases, such as a car or a house, something that you may not be able to afford upfront. Additionally, having a good credit score can lead to lower interest rates on loans and credit cards, which can save you money over time. For example, landlords may check your credit history to determine reliability, making good credit crucial for rental applications.</p>
    <p><strong>Proper usage:</strong></p>
    <p>To use credit cards properly, it involves a responsibility of financial management. This includes paying off your balance in full each month to avoid interest, not maxing out your credit limit, and making payments on time to avoid late fees and negative impacts on your credit score. More importantly, only use credit for planned purchases or emergencies, not for impulse buying. By doing so, you can build a strong credit history, increase your credit score, and benefit from the financial opportunities that good credit provides.</p>
    <p><strong>Credit card types:</strong></p>
    <p>There are different types of credit cards:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Airline Credit Cards:</strong> Airline credit cards are tailored for frequent travelers. These cards typically offer rewards in the form of airline miles or points for every dollar spent on purchases, which can then be redeemed for flights, upgrades, and other travel-related perks.</li>
        <li><strong>Cashback Credit Cards:</strong> Cashback credit cards offer a percentage of the purchase amount back to the cardholder as a rebate or statement credit. This type of credit card is popular because it provides tangible benefits in the form of cash rewards for everyday spending.</li>
        <li><strong>Store Credit Cards:</strong> Store credit cards are issued by retailers and can only be used for purchases at specific stores or within a particular retail network. These cards often come with incentives such as discounts on purchases, special financing offers, or loyalty rewards for frequent shoppers.</li>
        <li><strong>Student Credit Cards:</strong> Student credit cards are designed for college students who are new to credit or have limited credit history. These cards often have lower credit limits and more relaxed approval criteria compared to traditional credit cards, making them accessible to students with little or no credit history.</li>
