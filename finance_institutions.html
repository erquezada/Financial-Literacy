      <h2>Financial Institutions: Providing Comprehensive Services</h2>
      <p>Financial institutions play a crucial role in the global economy by offering a wide range of services and products to customers. They serve as intermediaries between those who have funds (investors, depositors) and those who need funds (borrowers, investors).</p>
